<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Arroz con leche is a dish made from rice mixed with water or milk and other
  ingredients such as cinnamon, vanilla and raisins.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup rice</li>
  <li>6 cloves</li>
  <li>4 cinnamon sticks</li>
  <li>6 cup water</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>3 cup evaporated milk</li>
  <li>1 cup sugar (white, granulated)</li>
  <li>Â¼ cup raisins</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons butter (salted)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Soak the rice, cloves and cinnamon sticks in 2 cups of water and let sit for
    a couple of hours. This step is optional, and it's my own method for cooking
    the rice.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the 2 hours have passed, pour the remaining 4 cups of water into a
    medium (1 gal [4 lt]) iron o cast aluminum pot. Add in the rice (including
    the water in which it was soaking, cinnamon and cloves). Add the salt.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cook over medium temperature and stir regularly to avoid sticking. When the
    rice is tender (about 20 mins) add milk and sugar. When it breaks a boil
    again add the raisins. Cook over low heat until the mixture reaches a
    pudding-like consistency.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove from the heat. Remove the cloves and cinnamon sticks. Add the butter
    and mix well. Cover and let it cool down to room temperature.
  </li>
  <li>Stir to incorporate the crust that forms during cooling.</li>
  <li>Serve in small bowls.</li>
</ol>
